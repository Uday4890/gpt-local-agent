## Examples / Demo Projects

This repository includes demo projects generated by the Local GPT Dev Agent to
validate real-world usage.

### Blog API Demo

A full-stack demo generated entirely through agent prompts:

- Backend: FastAPI + SQLite
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Features:
  - Create blog posts
  - List persisted posts from the database
  - API tested via Swagger UI, curl, and frontend

The demo demonstrates that the agent can:
- Scaffold backend APIs
- Create and wire database models
- Generate frontend clients
- Run and iterate on projects inside a sandboxed workspace
