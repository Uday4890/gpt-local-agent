# Local GPT Dev Agent

A semi-autonomous coding agent that runs on your PC and can:
- create folders / files,
- refactor code across multiple files,
- run commands (python, git, npm, etc.) inside a sandboxed workspace.

## How it works

- `agent.py` – main agent script
- `agent_workspace/` – sandbox directory where the agent creates projects
- Uses OpenAI tools API to call file + shell tools

## Demo project: Blog API (generated by the agent)

Inside `agent_workspace/blog-api/` there is a full-stack example:

- `app/` – FastAPI + SQLite backend (CRUD for posts)
- `frontend/` – React + Vite frontend that talks to `/posts/`
- This project was scaffolded and implemented by the local GPT agent, using natural-language prompts.
