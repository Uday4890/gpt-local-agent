# GPT Local Dev Agent 🧠💻

A **local, semi-autonomous GPT-powered dev agent** that can scaffold, edit, and run real software projects on your PC.

Unlike “chat-only” usage, this agent can:
- Create folders and files
- Read and refactor code across multiple files
- Run shell commands (`python`, `pip`, `git`, `uvicorn`, `npm`, etc.)
- Build complete backend + frontend projects via natural-language prompts

All agent actions are executed inside a sandboxed workspace directory.

---

## How it works

- `agent.py` – main CLI agent
- Uses OpenAI tool calling to:
  - List directories
  - Read / write files
  - Run shell commands
- All generated code lives inside:
agent_workspace/

sql
Copy code

You interact with the agent like a dev teammate:

```text
create a new project "blog-api" in python using fastapi and sqlite and make it production-ish
The agent then:

Creates project structure

Writes code

Generates README and dependency files

Can install dependencies and run the app

Running the agent
1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Uday4890/gpt-local-agent.git
cd gpt-local-agent
2. Create and activate virtual environment
Git Bash (Windows):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
CMD:
cmd
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install openai python-dotenv
Create a .env file in the repo root:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
4. Run the agent
bash
Copy code
python agent.py
Generated demo project: Blog API
This repository includes a real demo project fully generated by the agent using natural-language instructions.

Stack
Backend: FastAPI + SQLite

Frontend: React + Vite

What this demo proves
The agent can scaffold complete backends

It can generate frontend clients

It can run and iterate on real projects

Outputs are Git-ready and executable

⚠️ This demo is not a production app — it exists purely to validate the agent’s capabilities.

➡️ See agent_workspace/blog-api/README.md for full setup and run instructions.

Why this project exists
I wanted something beyond “chat with GPT”.

This project explores:

Local LLM-driven development

Tool-augmented code generation

Treating GPT as a dev agent, not a chatbot

Real filesystem + command execution under controlled constraints

Future ideas
Better active-project context

Test generation

Formatting & linting tools

Dockerized environments

Additional demo projects
